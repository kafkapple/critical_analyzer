feat: Implement two-step integration, fix Mermaid diagram, and sort files

   3 - Implemented a two-step integration process to handle long contexts:
   4   - Step 1: Generate integration analysis summary using `integration_analysis_v4.txt`.
   5   - Step 2: Generate final report based on the analysis summary using
     `integration_report_v4.txt`.
   6 - Added `two_step_integration` option and new prompt paths to `configs/mode/integration.yaml`.
   7 - Modified `src/main.py` to support the new two-step integration logic and fixed a syntax
     error.
   8 - Fixed Mermaid diagram syntax in `prompts/integration/individual_summary_for_integration.txt`
     to resolve parsing errors.
   9 - Ensured file processing order by sorting files alphabetically/numerically in
     `src/file_handler.py`.
